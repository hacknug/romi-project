Fab Lab Barcelona at IAAC develops an aerial robot that can be used by farmers. It also performs real-world tests in the experimental gardens at the Valldaura Labs and the Benifallet Ecological Rural Lab (BER-LAB) to imagine end-user scenarios. They help deliver the robotics platform to new markets, managing the communication and user communities.
