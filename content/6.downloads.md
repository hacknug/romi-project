### WP6 - Plant modelling

The ROMI project develops a toolbox for plant scanning and analysis that combines different approaches. In WP6 we develop an approach that is heavily based on plant models. These models are used as a support for the data analysis and plant segmentation but also as a source for synthetic images used to train neural networks.

We have had many opportunities to present ROMI both toward the general public as to a professional audience. The details can be found in this deliverable. In addition, we (SONY, FEI, IAAC under the coordination of FEI) worked on several studies (not planned in the original grant agreement) with the goal to better understand the markets of planned ROMI results (European vegetable microfarms) and our competitors (technologies, companies).
