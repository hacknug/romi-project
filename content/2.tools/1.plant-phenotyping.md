# The ROMI Plant Imager

::base-card{}
The ROMI Plant Imager performs full 3D analyses of plants. It combines a physical scanning station that uses an RGB camera with a powerful image processing pipeline, the Plant Interpreter, to build a 3D representation of plants.

The ROMI project develops a 3D plant phenotyping platform adapted to single potted plants. The Plant Imager is being finalized in controlled indoor settings for a future use in research laboratories. However, its use in controlled farming environments, such as greenhouses, is envisioned as a mid-term application.

The package consists of several modules, including:
- the Plant Imager: the physical hardware
- the Virtual Plant Imager: to collect images of 3D plant models
- the Plant 3D Vision: our library to analyse the data
- the Plant 3D Explorer: to inspect the results online

The analysis pipeline uses both geometrical algorithms and Machine Learning techniques. It is developed in collaboration with the research on [plant modeling and AI](/research/modeling).
